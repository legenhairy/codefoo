### Step 1: Show your enthusiasm and passion for IGN in the form of a YouTube/Vimeo video, written document, audio track, or whatever format you feel most comfortable with.

### Step 2: Legend has it, the tower is completely filled with Poké Balls, enough Poké Balls for Team Rocket to amass an army of Pokémon! Fortunately, a slumbering Pokémon is known to sleep at the bottom of Lombard St and block the entrance to Coit Tower entirely. If Team Rocket determines how to wake the sleeping giant and successfully steals the cache of Poké Balls that fills Coit Tower, about how many Poké Balls would they walk away with? Describe each step in your thought process.

### Step 3: Create a program that will determine the armor set of the highest value based on Geralt’s available currency ( Crowns ). An armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as an extra piece that can be of any type.
